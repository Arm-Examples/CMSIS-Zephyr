# CMSIS-Zephyr
This repository contains examples showing how to use the Arm CMSIS Debugger with Zephyr-based projects.

**Alif_E7_Zephyr/Blank_solution** folder contains a Zephyr HelloWorld CMSIS solution example project, which is built by Zephyr West tool and debugged by CMSIS-Debugger extension.

**Alif_E7_Zephyr/ipm_arm_mhuv2** folder contains a [ipm_arm_mhuv2](https://github.com/alifsemi/sdk-alif/tree/main/samples/drivers/ipm/ipm_arm_mhuv2) CMSIS solution example project from Alif-Zephyr-SDK, which is built by Zephyr West tool and debugged by CMSIS-Debugger extension. This example demonstrates inter-core communication between two Cortex-M55 cores using Arm's Message Handling Unit v2 (MHUv2). Also, it showcases the use of Zephyr's Inter-Processor Mailbox (IPM) API to exchange messages and trigger interrupts between cores.

**STM32H7B3I-DK_Zephyr** folder contains contains a Zephyr HelloWorld CMSIS solution example project, which is built by Zephyr West tool and debugged by CMSIS-Debugger extension.
